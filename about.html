                        Good evening we are from Ukraine!
                    </p>
                    <p class="page_description_">
                        Hello! My name is Nazar, I am 21 years old, and yes, I am from Ukraine.
                    </p>
                    <p class="page_description_">
                        I was born in the small village of "********", which is located in western Ukraine, this village was spent almost all my childhood. In 2019, after graduating from school, despite the fact that I have been drawing since childhood, loved everything related to art and, moreover, always saw myself as a successful actor in the future, I entered Lviv University with a degree in management.
                    </p>
                    <p class="page_description_">
                        Why did I do that?
                    </p>
                    <p class="page_description_">
                        Because after graduation it was the best option for me, in order to enter the university as an actor, I would have to move to Kyiv, as in the city of Lviv universities do not have such a specialty, in addition, the cost of tuition would be many times higher , based on this, the choice was made in favor of Lviv University.
                    </p>
                    <p class="page_description_">
                        After one year of study, my interest in the profession of management dropped sharply and in addition to management, I began to study design on their own, after several successful works that became popular on the Internet, I began to receive orders, everything changed on February 17. Exactly on February 17, exactly a week before the war, I moved to beautiful Kyiv to start all over again, to start as I want.
                    </p>
                    <p class="page_description_">
                        As you may have guessed, I was in Kyiv for a short time, I returned home on February 25, I will not describe the tragedy that took place on February 24 and continues to this day, you already know everything very well.
                    </p>
                    <p class="page_description_">
                        While at home, I became interested in the nft industry, and soon came up with the idea to create my own project, my own NFT collection.
                    </p>
                    <p class="page_description_">
                        Despite the difficulties, I am glad to present the Marko Polo project developed entirely by me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="page_description_">
                        This story briefly describes my life, it also tells how and under what conditions the main idea of the project appeared, over time the description of the project will change, this chapter will describe the Marko Polo project and its main goals, the project will be improved and refined, it all depends on your support. My friends and I also provide humanitarian aid to IDPs, so 25% of the proceeds will be used to help people who are forced to flee their homes fleeing the war.
